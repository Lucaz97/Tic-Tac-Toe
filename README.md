# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a project I worked on during last year of highschool. 
My goals were: improve my Java skills and try to understand the minimax algorithm. 
At the end I had to look up the solution of a tutorial to get the AI working properly.
It was fun to try to make for the first time a GUI with Java FX 

When I'll have time I'll write documentation about this project.
